## Introduction

**Cautious Invention** is a platform and toolkit for creators, designers, and engineers who wish to develop innovations that are not only groundbreaking but also carefully designed with consideration for the future. Whether you're creating a consumer product, a piece of technology, or a large-scale invention, this project provides the tools and frameworks needed to think through the safety, sustainability, and ethical implications of your work.

The project was born from the idea that every invention carries the potential for both good and harm. We believe that by adopting a cautious approach, creators can avoid unintended consequences and create inventions that are not only innovative but responsible.
